# Automatic Washer Control System

This project implements a fuzzy logic-based automatic washer control system using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system takes into account various factors such as dirtiness level, load weight, dirt type, cloth sensitivity, and water hardness to recommend optimal settings for a washing machine, including wash time, spin speed, water amount, detergent amount, and water temperature.

## Features

- **Fuzzy Logic System:** Utilizes the scikit-fuzzy library to define fuzzy membership functions and rules for decision-making based on input parameters.
- **GUI Interface:** The GUI is built using Tkinter, providing a user-friendly way to input parameters and receive recommended washing settings.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is designed to be responsive and intuitive, with sliders for input parameters and dynamic updates of recommended settings.
- **Optimization:** The system aims to optimize washing efficiency based on input conditions, adapting to different levels of dirtiness, load weights, and water characteristics.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (Tkinter, NumPy, scikit-fuzzy) installed.
3. Run the `main.py` file to launch the GUI application.
4. Adjust the sliders for dirtiness level, load weight, dirt type, cloth sensitivity, and water hardness.
5. Click the "Start Washing" button to receive recommended washing settings.
6. View the recommended wash time, spin speed, water amount, detergent amount, and water temperature on the GUI interface.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the system's functionality, optimize code, or enhance the GUI interface are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
